Overview
======================
This project is based on Vonage's [Media-Transformers-BackgroundEnchantments](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-media-transformers-samples/tree/main/ML-Transformers/BackgroundEnchantments) web sample application.

Changes Made
======================
* Integrated the app with OpenTok to establish a video call with a stream that applies background enchantments
* Added a mouse hover instruction to guide users when they hover over
* Added a container for the publisher and the subscriber under the original container

How It Works
======================
* Clicking the `BLUR` button applies a `High (10px)` strength blur. Clicking it increases the blur with a custom radius of `30px`.
* Clicking the `VIRTUAL` button applies a background image. Clicking it again will change the background to another image.

How to Launch the App
======================
Install the dependencies and run the app as same as the instructions explained here [ML-Transformers/BackgroundEnchantments](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-media-transformers-samples/tree/main/ML-Transformers/BackgroundEnchantments).
